    What?
    > You need to duplicate the text color as a fill property, since SVG does not understand the color CSS property. Actually, one don't have to duplicate. You can use the “fill: currentColor” rule, and it will inherit a value from the parents ‘color’ rule.

    ```<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>``` must go before ```<?xml-stylesheet...>```
