    ## Project is a success. 
    Inspired by an archetecture book in Berlin. The book was a collection of epic hostel designs.

  //-   # Project Goals
  //-   Coding patterns and applying is instrumental for typography and style rich web interfaces. 
  //-   Potential clients are clothing brands, bands, and events. 
  //-   To be relevent for the potential clients, this graphic should be a landing slide promoting X?
  //-   
  //-   # Strategy
  //- 
  //-   I found this beautiful book cover in Berlin at an outdoor book sale.
  //-   The pattern breaks down to a rows of circles with a weave of rectangles sitting on top.
  //- 
  //-   The 'weave' pattern, is composed of two layered patterns: 'horizontal-pattern', 'vertical-pattern'.
  //-   The 'circles' pattern, is represented by 'circles-pattern'.
  //- 
  //-   horizontal-rectanlges is generated by a series of rectangles 5px height, repeating every 10 px.
  //-   ```
  //-   <pattern id="vertical-pattern" x="0" y="0" width="10" height="100" patternUnits="userSpaceOnUse" >
  //-     <rect class="rectangle" x="0" y="0" width="5" height="100"/>
  //-   </pattern>
  //-   ```

    Found in Berlin! Fun!
    
    ## Learning Tidbits
  //- h4(name="centering-text-svg") Centering Text
    #### Centering Text inside SVGs
    
    1. Set the position of the text to the absolute center of the element in which you want to center it:
    * If it's the parent, you could just do x="50%" y ="50%".
    * If it's another element, x would be the x of that element + half its width (and similar for y but with the height).
    2. Use the text-anchor property to center the text horizontally with the value middle:
    Use the alignment-baseline property to center the text vertically with the value middle (or depending on how you want it to look like, you may want to do central)
    
    ```
    <svg width="200" height="100">
      <rect x="0" y="0" width="200" height="100" stroke="red" stroke-width="3px" fill="white"/>
      <text x="50%" y="50%" alignment-baseline="middle" text-anchor="middle">TEXT</text>    
    </svg>
    ```
    
    ## SVG Linking
    
    Basic example:
    ```
     <a xlink:href="http://www.w3.org">
     ```    
    
    ## Wrapping Text
    (refrence)[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5546346/how-to-place-and-center-text-in-an-svg-rectangle#5547084]
    As a primitive, text wrapping can be simulated by using the dy attribute and tspan elements, and as mentioned in the spec, some tools can automate this. For example, in Inkscape, select the shape you want, and the text you want, and use Text -> Flow into Frame. This will allow you to write your text, with wrapping, which will wrap based on the bounds of the shape. Also, make sure you follow these instructions to tell Inkscape to maintain compatibility with SVG 1.1: http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/FAQ#What_about_flowed_text.3F

    Furthermore, there are some JavaScript libraries that can be used to dynamically automate text wrapping: http://www.carto.net/papers/svg/textFlow/
