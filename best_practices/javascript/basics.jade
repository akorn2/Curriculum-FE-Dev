    Question: What is wrong with this code? Fix it!
    ```console.log("Current weapon: " + isArthur ? "Excalibur" : "Longsword");```
    
    
    Question: Why are we checking if this.swords already exists?
    Answer: We cannot pass a sword into an non-existing array.
    ```
    var armory = { addSword: function (sword) {
            this.swords = this.swords ? this.swords : [ ];
            this.swords.push(sword);
        }
    };
    ```
    Question: Re-write above with an 'or' operator:
    Answer: ``` this.swords = this.swords || [ ];```
    
    Question: With function above, add a 'Broadsword' to the armory.
    Answer: armory.addSword(Braodsword);
    
    Question: What is returned? ```var test = "" || undefined; console.log(test);```
    Answer: 'undefined' (because or operoator '||' takes last variable included).
    
    Question: Or operator '||' takes which values?
    Answer: First true value or rightmost false value.
    
    Question: And operator '&&' takes which values?
    Answer: First false value or rightmost true value.
    
    Question: Are all of these false values? 0 '' undefined?
    Answer: Yes.

    Challenge: Optimize this code to reduce calls:
    ```javascript
        //- console.log("You’ve found the following necklaces:”);
        //- for(var i = 0; i < treasureChest.necklaces.length; i++) {
        //- console.log(treasureChest.necklaces[i]);
        //- }
    ```
    Answer:
    ```javascript
    //- console.log("You’ve found the following necklaces:”);
    //- var list = treasureChest.necklaces;
    //- for(var i = 0, x = list.length; i < x; i++) {
    //-     console.log(list[i]);
    //- }
    ```
    
    Question: What is a constructor Function? Application Example   ?
    Answer: Properties can be set to constructor functions. These properties are accesed from other instance methods. 
    ```javascript
    function TagComponent (target, urlPath){
        this.targetElement = target;
        this.urlPath = urlPath;
    }
    TagComponent.prototype.render = function(){
        getRequest(this.urlPath), function(data){
            //..
        });
    }
    let tagComponent = new TagComponent(targetDiv, "/topics/17");
    tagComponent.render();
    ```
