    In 2013, Disney worked on a technology they called AIREAL. This system delivered non-contact haptic feedback through the use of air vortex rings. According to Disney, AIREAL helps users experience textures and "touch" virtual 3D objects in free space. This is all without the need for a glove or any other type of physical haptic feedback.
    Disney took on this research because they believed that technology is advancing towards more virtual or augmented reality applications. According to Disney, the missing piece in this emerging computer-augmented world is the absence of physical feeling of virtual objects. Disney's main intention for this research was to encourage other research regarding new applications of non-contact haptic feedback.[49]

    Researchers at the University of Tokyo are working on adding haptic feedback to holographic projections.[53][54][55] The feedback allows the user to interact with a hologram and receive tactile responses as if the holographic object were real. The research uses ultrasound waves to create (acoustic radiation pressure)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_radiation_pressure], which provides tactile feedback as users interact with the holographic object. The haptic technology does not affect the hologram, or the interaction with it, only the tactile response that the user perceives. The researchers posted a video displaying what they call the Airborne Ultrasound Tactile Display.[32] As of 2008, the technology was not ready for mass production or mainstream application in industry, but was quickly progressing, and industrial companies showed a positive response to the technology. This example of possible future application is the first in which the user does not have to be outfitted with a special glove or use a special control—they can "just walk up and use [it]" (refrence)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology#cite_note-physorg1-32](refrence)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology#cite_note-autogenerated1-56]


    # Projection Mapping
    Video mapping software such as MadMapper, Qlab, Troixatronix's Isadora, FaçadeSignage and VPT 6.0 are all downloadable for use in projects like these, though Adobe Photoshop, Adobe After Effects, Blender Blam!, and other packages can also be used by a creative artist. Also, extensible open-source software frameworks such as MPM (Multi-Projector-Mapper)[7] are available among others. Projection mapping can be separated into four categories:
    VJ'ing or VeeJay-ing (video Jockeying) used where live events are augmented by (often interactive to music) projections which are fully dynamic, controlled live, and consist of pre-programmed videos and combinations of effects and effect overlays.
    Theatrical: where projections are preset and scenes are "cued" on demand, usually in a set order, in conjunction with dance or onstage performance, often interactive.
    Static/Interactive: where a display is set up and loops or interacts with the environment and viewers via programming.
    Video: where a generally long segmented show is present as a single fluid video that is not interactive and plays from beginning to end.
