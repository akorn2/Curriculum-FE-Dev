    ### Custom Project Templates

    So maybe you like the idea of roots, but coffeescript isn't your thing. Or it bothers you that requirejs is the default and you prefer another way of doing it. Or maybe (*shudder*) you like twitter bootstrap by default. As of `v2.0.0`, roots allows you to create custom roots templates and use them to initialize your projects.
    
    ```bash
    $ program /foo/bar
    ```
    I implore you to check out [katon's documentation](https://github.com/typicode/katon) for all of your other sever needs (express, rails, python) &mdash here I'll go through how simple the roots workflow can be.

    ### Set-up

    In your project's directory, run:

    ```bash
    $ katon add 'roots watch --port $PORT --no-open'
    ```
    
    > **Note:** Since katon will shut your server down if you don't make a request within an hour, the `--no-open` option just prevents roots from popping up a new tab when katon restarts your server after a period of inactivity.

    ### Alternate Set-up
