Maslow's Hierarchy outline the values to balance for a full life.

How do I score?
Do I posses a sense of belonging?
Yes. I feel to be a valuable member of the Digital Nomad community.
We help each other. We share a lot of exciting times. We share common personality traits. We create plans in the future together.

Genuinely myself.
Graphics are my thing. Time is lost when in Illustrator - when adjusting a visual space. Revising stories is also one of my favorite activities. Conversations are also gems. This combo has helped me realize my career focus of graphically telling naratives through ditigally developed interfaces.
I'm also an idea person. Which keeps drawing me to Entrepenuership, but I am a creater not a business person. So My idea storming skills would be better suited to creating content and experiences.

Common theme is expression, Expression of an idea through an image, narrative, oracle story...

      ### Why this approach to learning?

      Usually I learn a stack by breezing through the first 1/5 of the documentation, diving into an example, and hacking together my own project. This works for rapid development, but its coding with a hatchet.

      To develop my own style, I focus on replicating inspiring refrences into SVGs for web interfaces.

      ### Why focus so deep on FE?

      I love story telling. I am fascinated by human kinds progress through the ages to utalize technology in sharing information. From the Greek Theatres, to Lithograph newspapers... I love potential a story holds. I want to champion cutting edge story structures to communicate the most effective messages. The words only tell a part of the story. The essence of a story is provided through the story teller. It's the actor's pauses, the graphics pairings in newspapers, and a web interfaces negative space. Its the space inbetween the worlds that gets me excited.

      FE is fascinating - as a story telling medium. The presentation of data is more of an Art...
      Plus performance matters.

      This is an exciting time for FE as web users can load very large sites. Cross browser also posses and interesting problem requiring specialization.
      Upon the horizon is also AR, which will re-invent every website.

      ### Where is FE Mastery Valuable?

      Graphics designed for load performance accross any resolutions: Convert Vector to SVGs to Webfont.

      ### Other
      I am proud to be Front-End developer. I strive to be one of the best. SVG are a vital ingredient for load performance and style.

      Coming from a design background, I understand the importance of having an unique style. Check out my tile project for case studies in persuit of style development.

      I repurpose succesful code examples, recreate sucessful designs in various fields as a svg, sell micro-services with svg, provide value to potential mentors with code to inject into their current website,
